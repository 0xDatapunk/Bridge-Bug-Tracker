# Bridge Bug Tracker

A community-maintained collection of bugs, vulnerabilities, and exploits in cross chain bridges.

Layer 2s, the most popular scaling solution for Ethereum at the moment, would not be possible without bridges. By their nature, bridges have become honey pots for exploits, occasionally with critical severity impact. This repo consolidates past exploited bridge bugs along with various bridge security resources in one place in the hope of making bridges more secure. These resources can be used as a reference for developers, auditors, and security tool makers.

#### Contributing
If you would like to contribute, there are two ways to do so:
1. Create a PR, filling in all of the necessary details yourself
2. Create an issue with a link or description of the bug or common vulnerability. The repo maintainers will then fill out the relevant details in a PR.

| 2022-03-20 | [Li Finance](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/project-showcase/dex/li-finance/) | $570K | <details><summary>allow calls to any contracts</summary>*The hack took advantage of our pre-bridge swap feature. Our smart contract allows a caller to pass an array of multiple swaps using any address with arbitrary calldata.<br><br> This design gave us maximum flexibility in what DEXs we could call and what methods we could call. This also allowed anyone to call other contracts, not just DEXs. Our contract checks to make sure that the result of the swap or swaps is enough tokens to continue the bridging operation.<br><br>The attacker started by passing a legitimate swap of a small amount followed by multiple calls directly to various token contracts. Specifically, they called the `transferFrom` method which allowed the attacker to transfer funds from users’ wallets that had previously given infinite approval to our contract for that specific token.<br><br>This worked because these calls were performed within the context of the contract, which had permission to transfer user funds. The attacker transferred these tokens into a separate wallet that he controlled.<br><br>Once the transfers were completed, the small amount swapped at the beginning was bridged, and the transaction was completed.*</details> | [blog](https://blog.li.fi/20th-march-the-exploit-e9e1c5c03eb9) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/LiFi_exp.sol) |
| 2022-02-06 | [Meter](https://docs.meter.io/) | $4.3M | <details><summary>missing `require(amount_from_calldata==msg.value)` in deposit()</summary>*The problem with this assumption is that Meter has two functions where users could make deposits: depositEth and the underlying ETH20 deposit function. The depositEth function fulfills this assumption and validates the amount of value in the transaction’s calldata, which is the value that will later be passed to the deposit function.<br><br>The other deposit function does not fulfill this assumption or check that msg.value equals the amount specified within the calldata. The attacker called this deposit function directly and passed it an arbitrary amount in the calldata. This value was then sent to the handler’s deposit function, enabling the attacker to drain value from the protocol.<br><br>Hundred Finance was affected by the attack because the local price of BNB.bsc was depreciated due to the hack. Exploiters were able to buy BNB.bsc at a discounted rate and use them as collateral for loans with Hunter Finance, who used the global Chainlink price for the assets. As a result, the attackers could drain uncompromised assets from the protocol. Two of the four opportunistic loans were repaid, leaving Hunter Finance out $3.3 million. <br> [...](https://halborn.com/explained-the-meter-io-hack-february-2022/)*</details> | [twitter](https://twitter.com/ishwinder/status/1490227406824685569) <br /> [blog](https://blog.chainsafe.io/breaking-down-the-meter-io-hack-a46a389e7ae4) | [source](https://github.com/meterio/chainbridge-solidity-v1.0.0-eth/blob/4aa52d503202fa50b6379be6696c73f2cd694864/contracts/Bridge.sol#L441) <BR> [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/Meter_exp.sol) |
| 2022-01-18 | [Wormhole](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/) | $360M | <details><summary>debt issuer: fake verification attack <br> fake account to precompiled sysvar</summary>*The `solana_program::sysvar::instructions` mod is meant to be used with the Instructions sysvar, a sort of precompile on Solana. However, the version of `solana_program` that Wormhole used didn't verify the address being used. <br><br>This meant that you could create your own account which stored the same data that the Instructions sysvar would have stored, and substituted that account for the Instruction sysvar in the call to `verify_signatures`. This would essentially bypass signature validation entirely.*</details> | [twitter](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1489044939732406275) | solana |
| 2022-01-28 | [Qubit Finance](https://docs.qbt.fi/protocol/bridge) | $80M | <details><summary>address(0).safeTransferFrom() does not revert</summary>*the contract did not use OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 library. If the contract had used this library, the exploit would not have been possible as the SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom function makes use of functionCall() (function from OpenZeppelin’s Address.sol contract) which verifies that the target address contains contract code. This is not the case with the 0 address. <br><br> The exploited contract used a modified safeTransferFrom() function which instead of making use of functionCall() to verify that the target address contained contract code, used the call() function directly. As the 0 address has no code at all, no code is run, and the call is completed successfully without reverting. As a result, the deposit function executed successfully but no real tokens were deposited. The Ethereum QBridge caught the Deposit event and interpreted it as a valid deposit of ETH.  As a result, qXETH tokens were minted for the attacker on BSC. <br><br> By repeating this process multiple times, the attacker was able to build up a large amount of qXETH without depositing any real tokens into the protocol.  The attacker then was able to convert these tokens into BNB, draining about $80 million in assets from the protocol.<br>[...](https://halborn.com/explained-the-qubit-hack-january-2022/)*</detail> | [rekt](https://rekt.news/qubit-rekt/) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/Qubit_exp.sol) |
| 2022-01-18 | [Multichain<br>/Anyswap]() | $1.4M | <details><summary>a) fail to validate token, b) fallback does not revert, c) infinite approval</summary>*address _underlying = AnyswapV1ERC20(token).underlying(); It’s intended to unwrap the underlying token (“DAI”) from the its anyToken wrapping (“anyDAI”). However, token now is now the attacker’s controlled contract. We can see in the debugger, that this contract now returns WETH as its “underlying asset”. Multichain failed here as this function should have checked if the token address is indeed a Multichain token<br><br>IERC20(_underlying).permit(from, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s); Originally, the expected result was that the underlying token’s (“WETH”) ERC20 contract permit() is called to approve the router’s (this) ability to withdraw an amount from the user’s (from) address, as the user supplied a signed transaction for that denoted by (v,r,s). However, WETH contract does not have a permit() function! WETH contract does have a “fallback function” that is called when a function is called but not found. WETH’s fallback function is deposit() that does nothing material in this case, but allows its calling function’s execution to continue as it does not fail.<br><br>TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(_underlying, from, token, amount); Originally, we expected that if we got to this line it means the signature in the line above was verified and now we can use the approve granted by it to actually move the the amount from the user to the router. However, the signature was not verified, as seen above. In theory, it should not be a problem, as although the attacker’s input should not have passed the signature validation, it did not approve the router access to transfer the funds on the victim’s behalf. However, Multichain’s dapp requested from all of its users a practically infinite approval sum. This insecure methodology is quite common in dapps, to save user expenses on gas. We had warned in the past that such behavior (we named it baDAPProve) can be hazardous in case of a rogue or a vulnerable dapp, and now this potential threat had materialized. By abusing this excessive approval, the function transfers the WETH amount from the victim account to the attackers’ controlled contract.*</detail> | [medium](https://medium.com/zengo/without-permit-multichains-exploit-explained-8417e8c1639b) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/Anyswap_poc.t.sol) |

So the attacker only needs to pass in the carefully constructed data through the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function for the _executeCrossChainTx function to execute the call to the EthCrossChainData contract PutCurEpochConPubKeyBytes function to change the keeper role to the address specified by the attackers.<br><br>After replacing the address of the keeper role, the attacker can construct a transaction at will and withdraw any amount of funds from the contract.*</detail> | [rekt](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/) <br /> [medium](https://slowmist.medium.com/the-root-cause-of-poly-network-being-hacked-ec2ee1b0c68f) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/PolyNetwork/PolyNetwork_exp.sol) |

When someone calls the contract it comes from the address of the contract always, and not from the input. Also, since the balance is from the EOA and not the contract, there is no transfer of ETH. This results in the Aurora Engine scheduling a transfer from its NEP-141 ETH balance to the adversary while it has not received an ETH transfer.*</detail> | Instead of removing the hardcoded contract address, given context, it turned out to be better to instead return an exit error if the address given does not match the inputs' address. |

This could have enabled an attacker to run a loop which doubled the balance of a contract each time, resulting in massive inflation and issuance directly to the attacker. |

Their section for the most popular [bridges](https://l2beat.com/bridges/tvl) outlines the risk analysis, technology used, and the addresses of the involved smart contracts. 

Another great resource for analyzing bridges is ["The Current State of Layer 2 Bridges"](https://entethalliance.org/2023-02-28-state-of-l2-bridges/) article by Dr. Andreas Freund. It provides a good summary on what bridges are, why they're important, and the most popular ones in production.
